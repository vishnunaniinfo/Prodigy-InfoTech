- <b>Password Masking:</b> For privacy, the tool masks the password input before displaying it.
- <b>Security Tips:</b> The program provides tips for creating secure passwords and maintaining good password hygiene.

<b>Usage</b>

1. <b>Run the Program:</b> Execute the script to start the Password Complexity Checking Tool.
2. <b>Read Tips:</b> Review the provided tips for creating a secure password.
3. <b>Enter Password:</b> Input the password you wish to check.
4. <b>View Feedback:</b> The program will display the masked password and provide feedback on its strength.

This code was developed as part of my internship at The Prodigy Infotech, demonstrating a practical approach to assessing password strength and educating users on creating secure passwords.
